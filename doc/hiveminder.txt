Provides filetype='hiveminder' for use with text file export from Hiveminder (http://hiveminder.com/)

tasks.txt is a formatted todo list which can be edited in place and sent back to Hiveminder to propagate changes.

The file can be generated by clicking on the text file export link on your Hiveminder page, or by using their todo.pl script with the download option.

The syntax will also work with the 'braindump' format temporary files generated when you run todo.pl with the 'braindump' option.  I've hacked my todo.pl to set the filetype when invoking vim to edit these, as they are blank tempfiles with nonspecific names.

INSTALLATION

Unpack the tarball into ~/.vim

If you want braindumps automatically detected, hack your todo.pl
Here's how I did it:
